# Spotify Screen Clone Project

#### In this project, I aimed to create a clone of the user interface of the popular music streaming platform Spotify. The project was designed using dummy data instead of real music data. My goal was to recreate the components found on Spotifyâ€™s screen in a general sense and to examine the user experience in the process.
